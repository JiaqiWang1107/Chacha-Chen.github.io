About me
======
Hi, it's Chacha. I am a senior undergraduate student in Department of Computer Science, **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**. 

I'm interested in the general field of **Data Mining** and **Machine Learning**. Particularly, I aspire to solve real-world problems using Machine Learning techniques. Big Data itself cannot be utilized and well-understood. I want to be a data scientist who is able to turn data into knowledge which, in the long run, make impacts and improve the living standard of human society.

Currently, I am working as a research intern of the City Brain project on **intelligent traffic signal control**, advised by [Prof. **Zhenhui Jessie Li**](https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jessieli).

We are doing very exciting and impactful things in Hangzhou. Here are some news about us!

## Research Experience

### Deep Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control 
_Research Intern, Advisor: Prof. Zhenhui (Jessie) Li Jul.2018 - Present_  

- Designed and implemented a reinforcement learning (RL) approach with justification on state and reward design for multi-intersection traffic signal control along arterials
- Draw a connection between RL method and classical transportation theory for the first time
- Justified our RL model in comparison to the closed form solution under the same simplified experiment settings
- Achieved the state-of-the-art performance in simulation on both synthetic and real-world traffic data
- Started conducting field experiments in Hangzhou China

### Mining Homeownership Patterns 
_Research Assistant, Advisor: Prof. Tingting Lu (Social Science) and Prof. Weinan Zhang Mar.2018 - Present_

- Formulated the task into a multi-class classification problem in machine learnig based on the data collected from a national scale survey
- Implemented logistic regression and tree model to predict the homeownership
- Interpreted the machine learning models with feature ranking and visualization which further reveals the
mechanism and pattern of homeownership

### SVM Toolbox for Both Indefinite and Semi-definite Kernel Learning 
_Research Assistant, Advisor: Prof. Xiaolin Huang Sep.2017 - Mar.2018_

- Coauthored a software package which accommodates Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithms with indefinite kernels and semi-definite kernels
- Incorporated Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) in the traditional SVM algorithm
- Provided various kernel functions, including TAHN, TL1, gaussian, polynomial and linear kernels
- Implemented various vector machine algorithms, including KVM, LSSVM, kPCA
